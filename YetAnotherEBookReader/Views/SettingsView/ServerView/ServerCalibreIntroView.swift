   ‚ó¶ Enable "Require username and password to access the Content server" to allow making changes to library, then setup user accounts
 ‚Ä¢ Advanced:
   ‚ó¶ Config SSL to enable HTTPS for maximum protection, especially when server is exposed to Internet
   ‚ó¶ Futher steps are required if you are using self-signed certificates
   ‚ó¶ We believe you can figure out yourself üòÅ (instructions on the road)
